# 2D Objects Detection Use Cases

Desc : A collection of 2D detection tasks

This is a place where I document my experiments in 2D objects detection. For each set of experiments, I try to include the :

* **Framework** : `darknet`, `tf-detection api`, `torchvision`, ...
* **Model** : YOLO, Faster R-CNN, ...
* **Training/Evaluation configurations** : nb. of epoch, batch size, ... 
* **Dataset** : The dataset, as well as its description.
* **Metrics** : The learning curve and the `mAP`. 
* **Image and Video results** : The result of the detection as bounding boxes on images and/or videos.
